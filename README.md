## Usage

__BValid__ goal is to help running a collection of assertions or rules on a business object to assess whether this
object is valid or not.

### Business Object

When using __BValid__, a business object is a Java class annotated with `@BusinessObject` that has at least one business
rule or one business member.

```java
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BasicRules;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessObject;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessRule;

@BusinessObject
public class Author {

   private String name;

   public String getName() {
      return name;
   }

   public void setName(String name) {
      this.name = name;
   }

   @BusinessRule("Author's name must be defined.")
   public boolean isNameValid() {
      return BasicRules.isDefined(name);
   }
}
```

Any sub-classes of a class annotated with `@BusinessObject` are also considered business objects
and can be validated.

### Validation

To verify a business object, simply call the `BValidator`:

```java
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.ObjectResult;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BValidator;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.RuleResult;

public class Example {

   public static void main(String[] args) {
      Author author = new Author();
      author.setName("Jules Verne");

      BValidator bValidator = new BValidator();
      ObjectResult result = bValidator.validate(author);
      if (result.isValid()) {
         doSomething();
      } else {
         for (RuleResult ruleResult : result.getRuleFailures()) {
            // handle error bad example:
            System.out.println(ruleResult.toString());
         }
      }
   }

}
```

Validation results can be explored using the `ObjectResult` class.

### Business Rules

A business rule is a __public__ method that takes no arguments, returns a `boolean` and is annotated
with `@BusinessRule` (the method must return `true` if the rule is validated, `false` otherwise).

```java
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BasicRules;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessObject;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessRule;

@BusinessObject
public class Author {

   // [...]

   @BusinessRule("Author's name must be defined.")
   public boolean isNameValid() {
      return BasicRules.isDefined(name);
   }
}
```

`BusinessRule` should be enriched with a meaningful description. It will help other developers to understand the rule,
but it will also be used in the validation report.

If requirement engineering is required, `id` attribute can be used to declare the requirement id.

```java
public class Author {

   //[...]

   @BusinessRule(id = "req-01", value = "Author's name must be defined.")
   public boolean isNameValid() {
      return BasicRules.isDefined(name);
   }
}
```

### Business member composition

Business objects can have other business objects as attributes to compose an aggregate (see DDD) or a business model.
__BValid__ is able to validate business members if they are defined via a __public__ accessor that takes no argument,
return a business object (instance of a class annotated with `@BusinessObject`) and is annotated with `@BusinessMember`:

```java
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BasicRules;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessMember;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessObject;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessRule;

import javax.security.sasl.AuthorizeCallback;

@BusinessObject
public class Book {

   private Author author;

   @BusinessMember
   public Author getAuthor() {
      return author;
   }

   public void setAuthor(Author author) {
      this.author = author;
   }

   @BusinessRule("Author must be defined.")
   public boolean isAuthorValid() {
      return BasicRules.isDefined(author);
   }
}
```

When calling `BValidator::validate`, all business rules of declared business members will also be tested to assess the
validity of the business object. If the business member's accessor return a `null` value, the member will be ignored. It
allows optional associations in models.

Composition support also multiple cardinality:

```java
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessMember;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessObject;

import java.util.ArrayList;

@BusinessObject(name = "library")
public class Library {

   public List<Book> books = new ArrayList<>();

   @BusinessMember(name = "books")
   public List<Book> getBooks() {
      return books;
   }
}
```

In this situation, the `BValidator` will go through all elements of the collection and validate them all.

Currently, only `java.util.Collection` and __arrays__ are supported. `java.util.Map` may be added in a future soon.

### Business object inheritance

Business objects can inherit from others business object. They will get all business rules and members from the parent
business object.

```java
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BasicRules;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessObject;
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BusinessRule;

@BusinessObject
public class Comic extends Book {

   private String artist;

   public String getArtist() {
      return artist;
   }

   public void setArtist(String artist) {
      this.artist = artist;
   }

   @BusinessRule("Artist must be defined if present.")
   public boolean isArtistValid() {
      BasicRules.isDefinedIfPresent(artist);
   }
}
```

In the example above, `Comic` will also inherit from the business rule `Author::isAuthorValid`.

### Default rules

__BValid__ provides the `BasicRules` utility to implement quickly default business rules to assert mandatory attributes
or cardinality.

```java
import fr.ceoche.bvalid.BasicRules;

import java.util.Collections;

public class DefaultRulesDemo {

   public boolean mandatoryAttribute() {
      // check is not null, and also not blank for Strings.
      return BasicRules.isDefined(attribute);
   }

   public boolean optionalStringAttribute() {
      // check is not blank if string is not null (Only for strings).
      return BasicRules.isDefinedIfPresent(stringAttribute);
   }

   public boolean oneToManyAssociation() {
      // check a collection or an array as at least one element.
      return BasicRules.hasOneOrMoreElements(collectionAttribute);
   }

   public boolean zeroToManyAssociation() {
      // check there are no null elements in collections or arrays.
      return BasicRules.hasDefinedElements(collectionAttribute);
   }

   public boolean oneToManyDefinedAssociation() {
      // check a collection or an array as at least one element AND no null elements.
      return BasicRules.hasOneOrMoreDefinedElements(collectionAttribute);
   }


}
```

To avoid too much coupling with __BValid__, you should encapsulate `BasicRules` behind an interface. See adapter
pattern.

## Ideas behind BValid

A business object or model, is usually seen as a stateful data structure with enforced business rules. However, business
rules are not always required to be verified, for example when data are pulled from an already verified database, there
should be no need to verify business rules again. As such, we usually prefer writing the business rules in methods
separated from constructors and accessors, use cases can invoke them whenever necessary.

Then instead of manually creating validation methods to call collections of business rules, we can use __BValid__ to
list all business rules using annotation and calling a default validator.

Ideally, we would have expected such library to be the least intrusive in the code, because we do not want our business
code to depend on an obscure framework ! Unlike the famous Jakarta-EE-Validation that is declaring validation rules as
annotations, we have decided that all business rules should be methods and should be written in plain Java. Annotations
are used only to reference them. So even if you decide to no longer use __BValid__ in your project, your code will still
have all its valuable rules.
